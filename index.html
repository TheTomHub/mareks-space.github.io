        <li>In my spare time or during sitting on the toilet I sometimes post <a href="instagr.am/marekdlugos">some photos of myself on Instagram</a>. Belive me there are a lot of them. Secretly wishing that one day I will become a model.</li>
        <li>In the past, I wasn't very much into blogging. I thought that no one would read it. Today I want to start <a href="https://medium.com/@MarekDlugos">sharing my experience with world on Medium</a>.</li>
        <li>Photography is my big hobby but unfortunately I don't have enough time for that. <a href="https://500px.com/marekdlugos">You can find some of my "photography art" on 500px</a>.</li>

        <li>I'm trying to be fullstack person because I dream about my own business. Want to have an overview of many areas therefore this is why I'm also coding and publishing it on <a href="https://github.com/marekdlugos">my Github</a>.</li>
