        p During the 4 months gap between graduating high school and starting of university I wanted to be an intern so I made one-page site describing my skills and how can I contribute to the business. The site made it as #[strong #1 on YC Hacker News]. Had over 30k visitors in one night and get huge media attention all around the world. Brought me over #[strong 150 emails] and secured job in Hawaii and later on an internship in Canada.

        p High-quality education abroad has been my aim for a long time, which is why I came up with hostmeinca.com when I was 16yo.

I got #[strong 30k visitors in one night], media attention all around the world and was even invited to talk at #[strong TEDx]. Despite this success, I have not managed to secure sufficient funding to study &amp; host family in California.
