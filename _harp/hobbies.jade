    p At the age of 20 I had an opportunity to #[strong travel all around the world]. My parents led me to traveling since I was a child but I don't remember a lot from that time. Now I am glad that I can afford to travel spending only my own money.

        p I was really fortunate when the instructor from social dance classes came to me during the break and asked me if I want to level it up. Saying yes to a lot of opportunities I started to dance with my wonderful dance partner Karolina who had already 10 year experience. We were crushing competitions together for year and half and I falled in love with this sport!
