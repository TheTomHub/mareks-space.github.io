        p I was fortunate to meet a lot of very interesting people and now I am happy to bring 5 interviews with some of them! I guess, I might be able to say it is a quality content, unfortunately, it is only available in the Slovak language.

        p Since I was always into the video after I finished my semester abroad in South Korea, I have decided to travel and film everything I experience. It was kinda my experiment whether or not I would like to do vlogging on regular basis. I ended up uploading 19 videos on YouTube from my travels through Taiwan, Philippines, Singapore, and Malaysia.

Saying yes to a lot of opportunities I started to dance with my wonderful dance partner Karolina who alrady had had 10 year of experience. We were crushing competitions together for a year and half and I fell in love with this sport!
